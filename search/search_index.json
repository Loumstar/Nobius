The separation of these two main aspects of content creation was the main idea we had in mind when making this tool. Early on, we realized that in general, all questions have a very similar structure, with parts, statements, answers and more. Following a strict structure would ensure the quality of each piece of content. However over time, we realized there is a certain degree of customization required to author effective content.

Currently it seems to reload the page without calling QuestionJavascript again, causing our whole custom logic to break down. In the future, we should move that button, and attach an extra event handler which would re-run that script, but it might now be as easy as that idk.</p> </li> <li> <p>Improve and get more accurate data collection.
